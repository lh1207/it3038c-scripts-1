# Project 2 

## Description

This script will provide information about the hard drive you choose that is connected to your computer.

## Getting Started
Before you start, make sure you run this command in Powershell or in another IDE that supports PowerShell scripts (.ps1). No additional software is needed.

### Installation

An IDE that supports .ps1 files will need to eb downloaded. Once the script is downloaded onto the computer, run it in the IDe of your choice. I prefer PowerShell ISE.

## Usage

Run the script and you will be prompted with input on the drive you want the script to get information from. Make sure you include a letter that represents the hard drive followed by a colon. An example of this is C:

Afterwards, the script will list information about the selected hard drive. Run the script again if you want to check anoher connected hard drive. 

## Enjoy!!
